# Nightclub Business Plan
## Project Main Idea/Goal:

* we want to find out the **minimum cost** to fulfilling the demand of the nightclub and also try to figure out how we are going to run this nightclub business for **maximum profit**.

## Project Goal for part (a) and part (b):

* **Part (a)** goal of this project is utilizing **Multiperiod Planning Programming** to calculate the minimum cost to produce the different drinks for nightclubs.
  * Most multi-period planning problems have a "planning horizon". $T = \left\{1,2,\dots,T^{\text{max}}\right\}$
  
* **Part (b)** goal of this project is utilizing **Integer Programming** to make a decision about which month we should open our nightclub, change to open as a bar, or not open both in different months based on the random dataset for the demand of the nightclub customers.

## Project Skills:

* Julia, JuMP
* Optimzer choice: Gurobi
* Integer Programming, Linear Programming (Multiperiod Planning Programming)
