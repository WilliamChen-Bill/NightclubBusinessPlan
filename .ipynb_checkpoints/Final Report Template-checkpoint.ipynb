According to the internet, UW-Madison is one of the party school, so we will assume that the maximum rate of the people go to the night club will be up to **0.4% (maximum) of the total enrollment (47936 from 2021 spring)**. We are aiming for open up the night club about **5000 square foot big night club**. The rential fee for per square feet in the Madison is about **\\$23.93**. To open up the night club we will need several basic equipment for us **(see the first table below)**. We will want to run this business for a half year. The admission fee for our club will be **\\$100**.

    "The opening days for our club will be Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday every week. The opening hours for each day will be 10:00 p.m. to 2 a.m. Fired a bartender will need 200 and hired a new one will need 512 which is the same price we pay our bartender wage. To generate the demand table we will restrict the student  to have too much alcohol in the night club. We will not have student to order same drinks more than 7. First, for business purpose we will like to know about what is the **minimum cost to meet the demand of the alcohol production and the recruitment of the bartender.** Since selling alcohol is  one of the main way to run the business for club. This is the first information we want to know.**(Part a)**"

Since we do really try to make this as real as possible, we reference date from the website. While we run several model, we realize to success with this business takes luckiness. It won't always run successfully. In fact, several implementation suggest us not to make this decision to open up either the nightclub or bar like this. This rebut the website suggestion. This make us think about whether website is \"lying\" or it  does require more in order to run a successful business. This actually interested me about what kind of the business strategy we can utilize to make this business success. In the future, I would like to utilize what I learned from this course to test our different business strategies try to make this business have higher chance to success. (ie. maybe consider into tradeoff case let the duality engage in to balance the min max??) that will be the future works. At this pointer, these will be the place where we end of this project."
