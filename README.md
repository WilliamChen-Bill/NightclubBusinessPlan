## Introduction
In this project, I explore the feasibility of running a nightclub business around UW-Madison. Most of the customers are assumed to be students from UW-Madison, considering the location of the business. The club size would be about 5000 square feet, with a rent of $23.93 per square foot. I've considered the cost of necessary equipment, staff wages, and other monthly costs while setting an admission fee of $100. 

## Mathematical Model (a)
The first part of the project involves creating an economic model using multiperiod planning programming to calculate the minimum cost to produce the different drinks and hire the necessary bartenders. 

## Solution (a)
The solution to the model indicates the minimum costs and the optimal number of bartenders required to meet the demand.

## Mathematical Model (b)
In the second part of the project, I expand the model to decide whether running the nightclub or transforming it into a bar would be more profitable. The bar model assumes 1/5 of the cost and production from the nightclub model.

## Solution (b)
The solution to the second model helps decide between opening a nightclub or a bar in each month, utilizing integer programming.

## Results and Discussion
Running the model several times with different datasets leads to one of the three outcomes: opening a nightclub, opening a bar, or not opening a business at all. 

## Conclusion
The results of this project offer a glimpse into the potential costs and considerations involved in opening a nightclub or a bar around UW-Madison. They reveal the risks involved in this business, suggesting that success might require more than just a solid business model. Future work could involve exploring different business strategies and tradeoffs to increase the chance of success.
